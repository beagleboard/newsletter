feature:
 title: Spring into Action!
 body: </p>Our Co-Founder Jason Kridner, reminds us that “The Projects tell the story.” In assembling this month’s newsletter we are so energized by the variety of projects using BeagleBoards® that are telling great stories.   From simple LED blink “hello world” projects from beginners to deep in the ocean rovers to space station research, BeagleBoard.org® based projects are inspiring!   We are excited to see how BeagleBone® and PocketBeagle® are enabling new ideas to spring into action.  We love spring; the air is full of energy and fresh ideas.  We want to hear about yours.<br>&mdash;<strong>Christine Long</strong>, <em>Executive Director</em></p>
