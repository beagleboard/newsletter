 title: Celebrating 10 Years of Open Source Collaboration
 body: <p><img src="images/10years_banner.jpg" style="float:right; height:50%; width:auto;"></p><p>It is so exciting to be in our tenth year of BeagleBoard.org® and we want to celebrate you, our community. Over the next 10 months, we’ll be <strong>highlighting memorable BeagleBoard.org® based projects.</strong> Please nominate a project using any BeagleBoard.org® hardware developed any time in the last 10 years to be featured in our newsletter. It can be your own project or someone else’s that has been memorable for you. <a href="#">Send us a link to a project</a> and tell us why you find it special. We can’t wait to hear from you! We are also celebrating the success and continuing efforts of BeagleBoard.org® to provide education in the use of open-source software and hardware in embedded computing. In fact, BeagleBoard.org® was announced in 2008 at a joint Educator and Developer Conference and embraced by a wider community. To celebrate and thank our educational members, starting this month we will be launching a new section of our newsletter <strong>spotlighting an influential instructor and their story.</strong> If you are an educator, we’d love to hear your BeagleBoard® story! <a href="#">Contact us for more information.</a> We hope you’ll enjoy celebrating 10 years of BeagleBoard.org® with us!</p>

   link: http://bbb.io/+a241e1
   body: Long before popular phone apps put features on faces, this application for BeagleBone® Black built on an OpenCV face detection sample, added a black mustache on the faces detected. Later enhanced to upload the picture to Twitter, it continues to be a classic favorite project.

   link: http://bbb.io/+fe12a6
   body: P10 and P5 LED panels have become a popular method of displaying images, text, and effects for animated Christmas Light displays. Traditionally, the community has been using an "Octoscroller" on a full Beaglebone Black for driving the panels. This cape provides much of the same functionality, but for the smaller/cheaper PocketBeagle.
