 title: Celebrating 10 Years of Open Source Collaboration
 body: <p><img src="images/10years_banner.jpg" style="float:right; width:40%; height:auto;"></p><p>It is so exciting to be in our tenth year of BeagleBoard.org® and we want to celebrate you, our community. Over the next 10 months, we’ll be <strong>highlighting memorable BeagleBoard.org® based projects.</strong> Please nominate a project using any BeagleBoard.org® hardware developed any time in the last 10 years to be featured in our newsletter. It can be your own project or someone else’s that has been memorable for you. <a href="mailto:Christi@beagleboard.org">Send us a link to a project</a> and tell us why you find it special. We can’t wait to hear from you!<br><br>We are also celebrating the success and continuing efforts of BeagleBoard.org® to provide education in the use of open-source software and hardware in embedded computing. In fact, BeagleBoard.org® was announced in 2008 at a joint Educator and Developer Conference and embraced by a wider community. To celebrate and thank our educational members, starting this month we will be launching a new section of our newsletter <strong>spotlighting an influential instructor and their story.</strong> If you are an educator, we’d love to hear your BeagleBoard® story! <a href="mailto:Christi@beagleboard.org">Contact us for more information.</a> We hope you’ll enjoy celebrating 10 years of BeagleBoard.org® with us!<br>&mdash;<strong>Christine Long</strong>, <em>Executive Director</em></p>
